							<h2>Ego-State model：Parent Ego State </h2>
						</header>
						<p>I grew up in a traditional family in Kaohsiung. I never left this comfort zone before I became an adult. My parents’ upbringing concept is very traditional and conservative. My family is not a rich family but the family motto of "Preferring sons to daughters" is passed down. Under the authority relationship, strict requirements are imposed on the sons in the family, compared with the free-range approach of the daughters in the family. Due to gender differences, the two elders in the family generally do not require much of their daughters’ schoolwork, but only require good conduct. Because I am the second child in the family, my parents hold on to my expectation that as long as they conform to a well-behaved personality, they can let me arrange their own life. Therefore, my personality development shows a clear outgoing attitude and a comparatively good attitude towards things. The son of Yu's family showed a bright and decisive personality, because the lack of the baggage that my parents expected made me feel more free to learn. Because of the traditional parenting concepts in my family, my parents’ behavior and dialogue are very pragmatically oriented. The "parental self-state" deeply affects my three views. Life is fulfilled and requires unremitting efforts to accumulate and make good use of Resources, and insist on goals, these attitudes are still deeply rooted in my parents' pragmatic and economical character until now.</p>
